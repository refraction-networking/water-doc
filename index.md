# WATER: WebAssembly Transport Executables Runtime

This site hosts the online documentation for Project WATER: [refraction-networking/water](https://github.com/refraction-networking/water) and [refraction-networking/water-rs](https://github.com/refraction-networking/water-rs). 

## WATER

WATER stands for WebAssembly Transport Executables Runtime, a novel approach to building pluggable network transports using WebAssembly. Comparing to other designs, WATER in general provides better flexibility and security, more consistent development and deployment experience, and better performance. 

A matrix comparing WATER with other pluggable transport designs is available [here](comparisons.html#water-vs-other-pluggable-transport-designs).
